	ModuleDesc = `**What it means:** AEM's BulkImportConfigServlet writes request parameters into ` + "`/conf/global/settings/dam/import/cloudsettings`" + ` under a privileged account, and the ConfDeliveryServlet reads them back — also privileged. Together they give an unauthenticated arbitrary JCR-property write with a read-back channel (CVE-2025-54246). When the written ` + "`sling:resourceType`" + ` points at a JSP that evaluates a property as Expression Language, it becomes server-side EL injection (CVE-2025-54247/54248) that leaks OSGi secrets.

**How it's exploited:** POST ` + "`importSource=UrlBased&sling:resourceType=<jsp>&action=x#{7*7}y`" + `, then read the node back through the ConfDeliveryServlet; ` + "`x49y`" + ` proves the EL evaluated.

**Fix:** Apply the GRANITE-61551 hotfix and deny anonymous access to ` + "`/conf`" + ` and ` + "`/etc/cloudsettings`" + ` at the dispatcher.`

	ModuleConfirmation = "Confirmed when a benign marker property POSTed to the BulkImportConfigServlet is read back verbatim through the ConfDeliveryServlet (pre-auth write), and/or a x#{7*7}y probe is read back as x49y with the literal #{7*7} absent (EL evaluated server-side), reproducing across rounds"
