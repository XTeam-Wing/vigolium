	ModuleDesc = `**What it means:** A Salesforce Experience Cloud site lets the unauthenticated Guest user read actual SObject records (Users, Contacts, Cases, Leads, custom __c objects) over the Aura getItems action — a direct leak of personal and business data. This is the "AuraInspector" / ShinyHunters exposure class.

**How it's exploited:** An attacker harvests the aura.context, enumerates objects via getConfigData, then POSTs getItems per object (paginated) to extract every record with no authentication.

**Fix:** Remove unneeded Guest User object/field read permissions, enable "Secure guest user record access", and declare Apex classes "with sharing".`
