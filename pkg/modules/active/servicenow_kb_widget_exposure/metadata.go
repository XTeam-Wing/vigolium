	ModuleDesc = `**What it means:** A ServiceNow instance exposes Knowledge Base article bodies to guests through the public KB Article Page widget. Knowledge articles are gated by User Criteria, not table ACLs, so the 2023 ACL hardening does not protect them — KB content (often internal procedures, credentials, tokens) stays guest-readable.

**How it's exploited:** An attacker gets a guest session and token, then POSTs the KB widget with ?sys_id=KB0000001. KB numbers are sequential, so an attacker enumerates them. A non-empty text/short_description confirms the leak.

**Fix:** Restrict Knowledge Base User Criteria so guests cannot read internal KBs; remove secrets from articles.`
